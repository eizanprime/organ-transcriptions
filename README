# Organ Transcriptions 

FOSS organ transcriptions

### What is this ? 

I am trying to make cool sheets with GNU lilypond, even though I am still a beginner. My goal is to make transcriptions that keep as much of the original notes as possible, making it possible for the reader to figure out every harmony and contrapunctal lines without having to be able to read the original orchestral sheets (yeah, so more like organ reductions rather than real "organistic" arrangements). 

I will try to make transcriptions for the final chorus of st matthew passion (more of a reduction, rather than the very organistic Widor version), maybe some Mozart works, I don't really know yet ! 

There are probably many things I forget when writing down so please send patches !
